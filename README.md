# HandsIn

HandsIn is a web application that will simplify and streamline the process of volunteering and community service for all parties involved. Currently, there is not any easy, centralized method to sign up to do volunteer work in communities. Websites tackling this problem are generally much more complicated than they should be. To fix this, HandsIn will provide a simple application that volunteers and volunteer seekers can log on to for either signing up for events, or posting volunteer opportunities. The application will have features that allow applicants and event organizers to be rated, so the public can view an individual’s or organization’s reputability. It will also let volunteers fill out forms that are often needed for community service to prevent having to fill them out more than once. Volunteers will be able to track their hours, and will be recommended on an ongoing basis more opportunities based on their past work in their area. Organizations will have to be verified to be able to post opportunities. The goal of this application is to centralize community service information in one application that is easily accessible and usable for all parties involved.
